### Cursor doesn't respond to tablet input {#cursor-not-moving}

OpenTabletDriver is likely missing OS permissions for *Accessibility* or *Input Monitoring*.

To solve this, navigate to `Settings -> System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> Privacy`, check both **Accessibility** and **Input Monitoring**.

If they are already checked, uncheck and recheck them.
